        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Macroeconomics</span> – the branch of economics that examines the economic behavior of aggregates – income,
          employment, output, and so on – on a national scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Microeconomics</span> – the branch of economics that examines the functioning of individual industries and the
          behavior of individual decision-making units, that is, business firms and households.

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Methods of Economics </span>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Positive economics</span> – an approach to economics that seeks to understand behavior and the operations of systems
          without making judgments. It describes what exists and how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Normative economics</span> – an approach to economics that analyzes outcomes of economic behavior, evaluates them as
          good or bad, and may prescribe courses of action. Also called “policy economics”.

        <span class="minitopic">Economic Systems</span>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Capitalist System</span> – an economy in which individual people and firms pursue their own self-interest without
          central directions or regulations. Also known as a laissez-faire economy, free enterprise, price mechanism, or free market economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Command Economy</span> – an economy in which a central authority or agency draws up a plan that establishes what will
          be produced and when, and makes rules for distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Mixed Economy</span> – a regulated market economy. In reality, all economies are, to some extent, mixed. It is just a
          matter of the degree of intervention.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Factors of Production</span>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Land (Natural Resources)</span> – encompasses all resources from the sea and land, such as raw materials, landscapes,
          ports (natural harbors), climatic conditions, and geographical location. Examples include forests, minerals, rivers, and fertile soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Labor (Human Factor)</span> – encompasses any type of work, whether mental or manual, performed with the sole purpose
          of receiving rewards. Examples include skilled and unskilled workers, professionals, and manual laborers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Capital (Man-Made)</span> – represents wealth used for production. Examples include machinery, buildings, tools, and
          technology used in manufacturing or service provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="keyword">Entrepreneur (Management)</span> – typically the organizer in a company responsible for risk-taking, innovation, and
          management. Examples include business owners, startup founders, and project managers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Price System</span>
        <p>
          Is the mechanism by which producers and consumers transmit information about production to one another. It is referred to as the basic
          coordination and communication system of a market economy because it helps producers make production decisions and thereby keeps the economy
          balanced.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Market</span>
        <p>A set of arrangements by which buyers and sellers of a good are in contact to trade that good.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Demand</span>
        <p>The amount of a good buyers want to purchase at different prices. It represents the behavior of buyers.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Quantity Demanded</span>
        <p>
          The amount (number of units) of a product that a household would buy in a given period if it could buy all it wanted at the current market
          price. For example, if the price of smartphones decreases, the quantity demanded may increase.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Demand Schedule</span>
        <p>
          A table showing how the quantity demanded of some product during a specified period of time changes as the price of that product changes,
          holding all other determinants of quantity demanded constant. An example could be a table illustrating how the demand for coffee changes
          with varying prices.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Demand Curve</span>
        <p>
          A graphical depiction of a demand schedule. It shows how the quantity demanded of some product during a specified period of time will change
          as the price of that product changes, holding all other determinants of quantity demanded constant.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Shortage</span>
        <p>
          Excess demand. For instance, if the price of concert tickets is too low, there may be a shortage because more people want to buy tickets
          than are available.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Opportunity Cost</span>
        <p>
          The value of the next best alternative that the decision forces the decision-maker to forgo. Rational decision making, be it in industry,
          government, or households, must be based on opportunity cost calculations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Surplus</span>
        <p>
          Excess supply. For example, if the price of a specific smartphone is too high, there may be a surplus because more units are available than
          buyers are willing to purchase.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="minitopic">Law of Supply</span>
        <p>
          The positive relationship between price and quantity supplied: An increase in market price will lead to an increase in quantity supplied,
          and a decrease in market price will lead to a decrease in quantity.

          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Redistribution</span> – This means transferring wealth from the richer sections of society to poorer sections.

          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Representation</span> – Taxes may also serve as a means for individuals and businesses to have a voice or
            representation in government decisions. Those who contribute to taxes may feel they have a stake in the decision-making process and expect
