  <div class="content">
    This topic encompasses the fundamental principles of arithmetic, including
    operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages. Number
    theory explores properties of integers, prime numbers, and divisibility.
    Business math involves applying mathematical concepts to real-world
    financial and economic scenarios, including topics like interest, profit and
    loss, and financial management.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">2. Basic and Advanced Algebra</div>
  <div class="content">
    Basic algebra introduces concepts such as linear equations, inequalities,
    and quadratic equations. Advanced algebra extends these principles to
    include polynomial functions, rational functions, and exponential and
    logarithmic equations, providing a foundation for more complex mathematical
    analysis and problem-solving.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">3. Plane and Solid Geometry</div>
  <div class="content">
    Plane geometry focuses on the properties and relationships of shapes and
    figures in two dimensions, while solid geometry extends these concepts to
    three-dimensional objects. Topics include angles, triangles, polygons,
    circles, and volumes of geometric solids.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">4. Trigonometry</div>
  <div class="content">
    Trigonometry deals with the study of angles and the relationships between
    angles and sides of triangles. It has applications in various fields, such
    as engineering, physics, and navigation, and includes topics like
    trigonometric functions, identities, and solving trigonometric equations.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">5. Probability and Statistics</div>
  <div class="content">
    Probability explores the likelihood of events occurring, while statistics
    involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Topics include
    probability distributions, statistical measures, hypothesis testing, and
    data representation.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">6. Analytical Geometry</div>
  <div class="content">
    Analytical geometry combines algebra and geometry to study geometric objects
    using coordinates. It includes equations of lines, conic sections, and
    transformations of geometric shapes.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">7. Calculus</div>
  <div class="content">
    Calculus is the study of rates of change and accumulation. It includes
    differential calculus, which deals with derivatives and rates of change, and
    integral calculus, which focuses on finding areas and accumulations.
  </div>
