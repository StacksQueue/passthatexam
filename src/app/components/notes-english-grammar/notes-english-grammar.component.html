        <span class="minitopic">Action Verbs</span> - These are verbs that express action. A majority of verbs are of this nature, and that is why
        most of the time, learners tend to define verbs as action words. Words like run, walk, talk, sing, dance, etc. are common examples of action
        verbs. We can further classify actions verbs into two more sub classifications-Regular and Irregular verbs.

            <b>Linking Verbs as Perception Corpulas</b> - Linking verbs, also known as perception copulas, connect the subject of a sentence to a
            subject complement that describes a sensory perception or condition.
            <div class="examples">
              <p>The flowers look beautiful.</p>
              <i>

              <i>
                In this example, the linking verb "remains" connects the subject "The book" to the state or condition of being on the shelf. Unlike
                action verbs, which denote movement or activity, "remains" highlights a static state. It indicates that the book is in a state of rest
                or in a fixed position on the shelf, emphasizing the lack of action or movement.

    <h4 class="topic">Interjections</h4>
    <p>
      Interjections are words that convey strong emotions or reactions, often standing alone as independent sentences with the speaker as the implicit
      subject.
    </p>
    <div class="examples">
      <p><b>Ouch!</b> That hurt.</p>
      <i> In this example, "Ouch" expresses pain, standing independently as a complete sentence. </i>
      <p><b>Aha!</b> I finally understood the puzzle.</p>
      <i>Here, "Aha" conveys a moment of realization, functioning as a standalone sentence indicating the speaker's excitement.</i>
    </div>
    <p>
      Interjections add emotional tone to language, reflecting the speaker's immediate reactions or sentiments. They are distinct in that they often
      don't play a grammatical role within a sentence structure but rather convey the speaker's feelings.
